Should support python v 3.7 - 3.10 (what Kivy supports)

Installing:

git clone https://github.com/tannmatter/cave
cd cave && python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
  or
pip install -r requirements_rpi.txt (for testing on Raspberry Pi systems with GPIO)

Running:

1. Copy cave/data/example_config.xml to cave/data/config.xml
2. Modify with your own equipment including addresses, ports, input codes, etc.
(You can calculate base64 input codes using driver as reference and base64.b64encode() in python library,
ex. base64.b64encode(b'\x00\x01') returns 'AAE=')
3. source venv/bin/activate
4. python app.py
