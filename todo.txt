TODO:
    I think that the config reader needs to be only responsible for reading the config
    and filling in the data structure for the app.  Once all of the data is filled in,
    a callback can be triggered (on_<propertyname> style for example) that would cause
    the app to use that data to create the required drivers and other things.
    As it's creating those device instances, it can also call into methods in the
    root widget class to create the interface.
